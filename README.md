# 🏴‍☠️ Captain Game – Jetpack Compose UI Demo

Captain Game is a simple and fun **Jetpack Compose UI-only demo** where the user sails in different directions and randomly finds treasure or hits a storm.  
This project demonstrates UI state management, button interactions, and dynamic text updates using Compose.

> ⚠️ **Note:** This project currently includes **only the UI logic**.  
> Full game logic, animations, sound effects, score storage, and more features will be added later.
